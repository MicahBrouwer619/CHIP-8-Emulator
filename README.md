# CHIP-8-Emulator

This project is a basic chip emulator for development later on in an NES enviornemnt.
The short description of chip 8 and it's components are as follows:
* 16 8 bit registers
* 4k bytes of memory
* 16 bit index register
* 16 program counter
* 16 level stack
* 8 bit stack pointer
* 8 bit delay timer
* 8 bit sound timer

The goal is to have it be able to load rom files and function as an emulator to run old games, and possibly write new ones.
